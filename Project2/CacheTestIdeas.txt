Test cases: 



Cache's capacity is 2. Called same key (2) 100 times -> should only miss once. 

Cache's capacity is 1. Called 2 seperate -> 2 misses. 

Caches's capacity is 2. Request a - a - b - a --> 2 misses.

Capacity: 5. Test the shift. Say call cache with 1-2-3-4-5()-1(*) then call 6 --- kick out 2 --> if call 2 -> should miss.
                                                         **(): call cache's miss here should be 5.
						 	 **(*): call cache's miss here should be 5.
